### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Complete Architecture Rewrite

This is a **major architectural change** moving from Python-based processing to pure Rust with ONNX Runtime.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed Python dependency entirely - now uses ONNX Runtime for inference
- **BREAKING**: Now uses converted HTDemucs ONNX model instead of Python-based Demucs
- Pure Rust implementation with no external language dependencies
- Significantly improved performance and reduced system requirements
- Simplified deployment - no need to install Python or Python packages

### Added
- ONNX Runtime integration for high-performance inference
- HTDemucs-ORT model (htdemucs_ort_v1) - converted from Meta's Demucs v4
- Built-in model registry for simplified model management
- Automatic model downloading with SHA-256 verification
- Progress tracking with `set_split_progress_callback()` and `SplitProgress` enum
- Model caching in system cache directories
- `prepare_model()` function for pre-loading models
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Previous Versions

Earlier versions (< 1.0.0) used a Python-based approach and are not compatible with this release.
